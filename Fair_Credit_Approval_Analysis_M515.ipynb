    "Over the past years, financial organizations have started using machine learning techniques to automate credit-card granting. This has been mainly facilitated by the need to enhance operations within the company, lower operational human-related errors, and increase consistency in decisions made. But the case of such technologies being applied in high-stakes decisions has brought up serious ethical issues, especially about fairness and prejudice in the results of algorithms. Social inequalities can be maintained or even generated by the outcome of the decisions made on the basis of biased models of financial access, such that it can lead to reputational as well as legal debts on the part of the institution.\n",
    "The issue, which is examined in the present research, refers to the fact that algorithms, which are utilized by automated credit-card approval systems, are biased. To be more exact, the danger lies in the fact that when machine learning models are trained using historical datasets, which frequently include prejudices of society in them, these issues are also internalized into the machine learning model. Without the necessary mitigation, these models can acquire and reproduce this kind of bias, create discriminatory results against selected groups of people, including people based on their gender, age, ethnicity, or marital status. There is therefore a need to evaluate and reduce the level of unfairness in such systems to allow fair treatment of applicants.\n",
    "The need to address this problem is not only based on moral issues. Not only are discriminatory lending practices prohibited implicitly by the broader regulatory framework of banking, in the United States and in other jurisdictions, but there are laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or ECOA, which specifically outlaw discriminatory lending practices. The financial institutions should therefore make proactive efforts to prove that automated systems of the entities adhere to the concepts of fairness and accountability.\n",
    "In order to study this problem, a real-life data set is to be chosen that comprises past credit applications and behavioural data. It is possible to formulate the credit-card approval prediction problem as a binary classification problem wherein the task is to predict whether a particular applicant should be approved or denied. In this context, the current study seeks to determine possible sources of bias in modeled outputs and implement the appropriate fairness-enhancing treatments, and assess their success through the appropriate fairness measure.\n",
    "Through the described issues, the proposed project aims to help build more socially responsible machine learning systems in the financial field. Finally, it is also expected that after implementing such an approach to model fairness, the community will be more open to the idea of using automated decision-making processes developed by financial institutions.\n",

    "The use of machine learning techniques in credit-card approval systems has brought some serious philosophical questions, especially regarding the notions of fairness and discrimination. Though it is often discussed that algorithmic solutions should be objective and impartial, in reality, their correctness and fairness rely directly on data quality and integrity upon which they are trained. Such information in numerous instances, historical financial information has been found to carry an implication of any known biases in the society, which, when acquired in the predictions, can prove to be unfair to others or groups.\n",
    "Among the main ethical issues to consider in this direction is the fact that resulting disadvantages in systems can be perpetuated unintentionally by the automation of the decision-making process. As an example, when a dataset is historically biased towards discrimination based on gender (women), ethnicity (minorities), or age (younger applicants), the risk is that a machine learning trained model will have the same inconsistencies in its predictions. Consequently, there is the possibility of unfair rejection of credit to applicants in protected demographic groups despite the fact that they might be financially hopeful as compared to other applicants. This was an issue termed as algorithmic bias, and it is well-documented in the literature field and poses as a crucial problem in the ethical application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry.\n",
    "Moreover, the very notion of fairness of the algorithmic systems is multidimensional. There are also several conceptions of fairness, being: statistical parity, equal opportunity, and individual fairness, each of which has various implications for the normative. When credit-card approval is involved, equal opportunity, that is, the equal chances of qualified applicants to be approved irrespective of sensitive attributes, becomes an especially pertinent criterion. As an alternative, the inability to exercise this principle can lead not only to an ethical malpractice, but also to a violation of legal laws that exist to prevent discrimination in lending.\n",
    "The urgency of this matter can be identified by the regulatory role of financial institutions. Countries and jurisdictions across the world, such as the European Union and the United States, have put in place laws that require that non-discriminatory treatment is exercised when making credit decisions. This is why it is also expected that institutions begin to audit their algorithms on fairness and implement mitigation strategies in case of this lack. Failure to do so can impose regulatory penalties, tarnish reputation, and cause the loss of trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of fairness will be tested in this study by establishing bias in the outputs of the model, concerning such attributes as gender, age, and marital status. Several measures of fairness will be used to measure inequality in the outcomes among demographic groups. As to why it is done, the project aims to highlight the ethical dangers of algorithmic decision-making in credit allotment and to offer a scrupulous method of bias prevention, which would be in line not only with the norms of the law but also with the societal demands.\n",

    "An organized machine learning pipeline was created to solve the problem of predicting creditworthiness using the information of applicants, and allowing one to evaluate and minimize the bias of the algorithm. The pipeline adheres to the framework, which was recognized by most industries and is based on preprocessing of the data, model training, evaluation of the performance, and fairness evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first extraction and combination of the data, the final feature of interest (`Credit_Status`) was derived based on credit transactions. Whether a customer was creditworthy (`1`) or not (`0`) was determined as follows: a client was designated creditworthy in the absence of any entry of serious delinquency. The thing is that the resulting dataset was highly skewed, and more than 99 percent of the applicants were ranked as non-creditworthy. In order to overcome the corresponding modelling issues, random undersampling of the majority class was undertaken to create a balanced sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "feature engineering was performed so that raw attributes could be converted into a form that can be modelled. The age and duration of employment of the applicant were based on negative days and were stated in years. Label encoding was used to encode categorical variables like gender, income type as well as housing status as numbers. It occurred that there were missing values in the column called `OCCUPATION_TYPE`, so they were to be filled with the placeholder, which is the text Unknown. Attributes that could not be predicted, like unique customer identifiers, were not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final space had 17 engineered features and 604 observations, which were 50% creditworthy and 50% non-creditworthy classes. The information was then divided into the feature matrix `X` and the target vector `y`, which is used as the model input to classification. In addition to promoting accurate prediction, this pipeline is also useful in fairness assessment concerning sensitive attributes, which makes it comply with the ethical orientation in this study.\n",

    "Methods of mitigating bias In machine learning pipelines, mitigation methods of bias are used when diagnosis of fairness indicates systemic disparities in predictive outcomes between or across demographic groups that are the subjects of legal protection. Nevertheless, in the given study, the fairness rating within the gender characteristic showed a very high level of equality between female and male prospects. The measured values with respect to the fairness (Statistical Parity Difference (0.0062), Disparate Impact Ratio (0.9877), and Equal Opportunity Difference (0.0576)) have all been within acceptable ethical and regulatory ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing as material unfairness was not present, pre-processing (e.g. reweighting), in-processing (e.g. fairness-constrained optimisation), or post-processing (e.g. threshold adjustment) was not necessary. The choice taken to leave the original model in the absence of bias intervention was made in order to maintain the interpretability and accuracy of predictive integrity and to also meet the standard of fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the design of the pipeline can be extended to accommodate future deployment cases where more demographic variables could be needed or new datasets could be available to mitigate. Acting in such a way, proper bias correction techniques can be implemented at the relevant pipeline step.\n",

    "The Logistic Regression model obtained an accuracy of 61.98% by using the balanced data, and its precision, recall, and F1-scores were identical in creditworthy and non-creditworthy classes. The equally balanced arrangement of the classes and evenness of assessment parameters showed that there is no monopoly of learning by one class.\n",

    "Fairness diagnostics also showed no unfair partition of the results of the model in terms of the gender attribute.

This was also confirmed by a visual correlation between positive prediction rates.\n",

    "This is a project in which the author studied whether a machine learning model that was created to automate the approval decisions of credit cards is fair. The creation of a binary classification model was created using a real-world dataset with merged records of applicants and their credit behaviour. Logistic Regression was chosen as a baseline because it is easy to interpret and is ethical in assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a stable dataset, systematic feature engineering and average class-balancing were done. The model was predictive in and diagnostics of fairness, alluding to a fairness level not significantly better than chance, based on gender. Well, no bias mitigation was put into action because of that. The pipeline also encompasses the ethical benchmark required in the system of financial decision making, consistent with the business, legal, and commercial aspirations in the society, on the fairness of automated services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research has confirmed that non-complex and interpretable models could be not only precise but also fair, built wisely, and judged responsibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline that is provided in the present research has proven that fairness in the automated decision-making process does not require algorithmic complexity. Through feature selection, having the proper preprocessing, and integrating fairness diagnostics in the modelling cycle, it was demonstrated that ethical risks can be addressed or prevented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is necessary to note that such fairness assessment was conducted on one regarding the single attribute of protection (`CODE_GENDER`) and a balanced part of the initial data. More general characteristics of demographics, e.g., race, ethnicity, or age, can also need examination in real-world uses. Moreover, there are new dynamics brought by oversampling and real-time streaming data that can influence the model fairness after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is concluded that to improve this model, it is suggested to experiment on bigger, diversified data sets to test the model and carry out auditing concerning fairness every now and then, to verify the compliance. Besides, stakeholders ought to contribute to the formulation of levels of fairness peculiar to the situations in the business and the laws of the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, though fairness received most attention in the current project, a multi-objective concept with a trade-off between fairness, accuracy, interpretability, and business utility is recommended when it comes to deploying ethical AI in financial services.\n",
